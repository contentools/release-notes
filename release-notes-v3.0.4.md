# Release Notes - v3.0.4

<p>Hello everyone! In our third&nbsp;release in June 2016, we are proud to announce we deployed an awesome new feature. Check it out!</p>

<h2>Zapier Integration</h2>

<p>We are really excited by integrating Contentools platform to Zapier! Initially we created only two kinds of triggers: <strong>New Idea</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>New Content</strong>&nbsp;(there&#39;s much more to come). To create a new zap using Contentools, log-in to zapier, create a new zap and search for &quot;Contentools&quot; on the trigger options. When Zapier asks for the API Key, you can generate a new one inside Contentools platform by accessing <strong><a href="https://go.contentools.com/p//user-settings-personal-info">User settings &gt;&nbsp;Personal Info</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>New Blog Post Editor</h2>

<p>After a couple weeks working to offer a brand new experience to our users, it&#39;s finally live! The new blog post editor was designed targeting on easyness and tightly coupling it with the content strategy and publishing integrations.</p>

<p>Of course we enjoyed the new editor while&nbsp;creating this release note.&nbsp;:)</p>

<h2>Invitation Auto Acceptance</h2>

<p>Inviting new team members doesn&#39;t recquire&nbsp;their confirmation&nbsp;anymore. Instead, they can remove themselves from any&nbsp;content strategy if they want to. As soon as a new member is invited, they&nbsp;can be assigned to their tasks&nbsp;on the project.</p>

<h2>General Improvement</h2>

<p>After these new hot features, we would like to show you a couple&nbsp;improvements we also made:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Inside the idea section of the content editor, Buying Stages without Personas are hidden;</li>
    <li>We added an alert message to users that forget to save ideas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Project selector wasn&#39;t scrolling properly. We added a nice scrollbar with fixed height.</li>
    <li>When mentioning someone without their name (i.e: a new invited team member) an empty lable was displayed. Now it shows the member&#39;s username.</li>
    <li>Internationalization issues and typos.</li>
    <li>Fixed trial message position.</li>
    <li>Minor scheduling issues with social posts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is comming?</h2>

<p>We keep on working on a new way to better integrate with Wordpress. We plan on enabling fine tunnings on the content directly inside Wordpress by using our new plugin. It will be awesome!&nbsp;Stay tunned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our team is desiging a solution&nbsp;to make comment threads&nbsp;inside the content editor. It will help users discuss about the given content and optimize the team communication.</p>

<p>We are happy to ship these features and improvements this week! Feel free to give us feedbacks (we love to hear your feedback).</p>

<p>Made with &lt;3 by Contentools Product Team!</p>
