Hello content nerds, this our first release in June 2016 and probably the last but one made this quarter. Our efforts were focused in improve some features on Contentools and some quick fixes. This week we had very few bug reports, motivating our team planning some new features that are comming (later on this article).

## Improvements
We developed some quick improvements to offer a better experience inside Contentools platform. You can check the following list:

## Bug Fixes
Here is a list of the few bugs we detected from our last release:

* Missed translations of some terms inside content professional profile for brazilian portuguese language.
* Some users were not receiving emails from Slave Roboto (our mail transaction agent nickname) due to a problem with SPF and DKIM.
* We had problems with SSL ceriticate on our website. No side effects to the platform security layer because we use a different certificate.
* The 'start production' button on ideas was enabled even for users without permission, even blocking the user from clicking it.


## What is comming?
We are proud to annouce we are almost finishing our brand new blog post editor with a lot of user experience improvements. Also, we have some big deliverables in the next weeks to improve the platform communication with wordpress, enabling users to edit the content inside the blog CMS and synchronize gain with Contentools platform. The ability to create blog posts with images in the content body is in development process too. We are very excited about these deliverables. Feel free to give us feedbacks!
